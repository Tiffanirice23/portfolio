I possess 7 years of prior experience managing aviation inventory specializing in large scale, project coordination, personnel management, and customer support. I made a switch into studying tech because I wanted a career that would intellectually keep me stimulated and after completing the full stack course at CodeFellows, I can safely say that I have found JUST THAT in being a developer. Please see the bottom of the screen for all of my socials and contact information!",
