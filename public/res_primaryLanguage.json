      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! My name is Tiffani Rice and I am a full stack developer currently living in the greater Seattle area. I possess 7 years of prior experience with aviation companies, such as General Electric, specializing in large scale, project coordination, personnel management, and customer support. In March, I made a switch into studying tech because I wanted a career that would intellectually keep me stimulated and after completing the full stack course at CodeFellows, I can safely say that I have found JUST THAT in being a developer. When I am not studing software deveopement, my relaxation go tos are exploring beautiful Washington parks, watching TikToks for a questionable amout of time, or listening to true crime or comedy podcasts ",
